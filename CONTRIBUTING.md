## üìù Content Guidelines

### Writing Style
- **Clear and concise**: Use simple language that beginners can understand
- **Practical examples**: Include real-world examples and use cases
- **Progressive complexity**: Start with basics and build up to advanced concepts
- **Consistent formatting**: Follow the established markdown formatting patterns

### Structure Guidelines
- **Logical flow**: Ensure content flows logically from one concept to the next
- **Cross-references**: Link to related concepts using relative paths
- **Prerequisites**: Clearly state what readers should know before each section
- **Learning objectives**: Start chapters with clear learning goals

### Technical Accuracy
- **Verify information**: Ensure all technical details are accurate and up-to-date
- **Cite sources**: Include references for external information
- **Test examples**: Verify that all code examples and configurations work
- **Review diagrams**: Ensure diagrams accurately represent the concepts

## üé® Formatting Standards

### Markdown Conventions
```markdown
# Chapter Title (H1 - only one per file)
## Section Title (H2)
### Subsection Title (H3)

**Bold text** for emphasis
*Italic text* for definitions
`code snippets` for technical terms

> Blockquotes for important notes

- Bullet points for lists
1. Numbered lists for steps
```

### Code Blocks
```markdown
```language
// Code example with proper syntax highlighting
function example() {
    return "Hello World";
}
```
```

### Diagrams
- Use Mermaid for simple diagrams
- Include alt text for accessibility
- Ensure diagrams are readable on mobile devices
