# Reliability Metrics

## Introduction

Reliability metrics measure how consistently a system performs its intended function over time. These metrics are crucial for understanding system stability, planning maintenance windows, and setting realistic expectations with users and stakeholders. Reliability is often more important than raw performance - users prefer a consistently available system over a fast but unreliable one.

## Core Reliability Metrics

### 1. Availability

**Definition**: The percentage of time a system is operational and accessible.

**Formula**: 
```
Availability = (Total_Time - Downtime) / Total_Time × 100%
```

**Alternative Formula**:
```
Availability = MTBF / (MTBF + MTTR)
```

**Common Availability Levels**:
- **99% (Two 9s)**: 3.65 days downtime per year
- **99.9% (Three 9s)**: 8.77 hours downtime per year
- **99.95% (Three and a half 9s)**: 4.38 hours downtime per year
- **99.99% (Four 9s)**: 52.6 minutes downtime per year
- **99.999% (Five 9s)**: 5.26 minutes downtime per year

**Example Calculation**:
```
System operational time in a month: 29.5 days
Total time in month: 30 days
Downtime: 0.5 days = 12 hours

Availability = (30 - 0.5) / 30 × 100% = 98.33%
```

### 2. Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)

**Definition**: The average time between system failures during normal operation.

**Formula**: 
```
MTBF = Total_Operational_Time / Number_of_Failures
```

**Example Calculation**:
```
Operational time: 8,760 hours (1 year)
Number of failures: 4

MTBF = 8,760 hours / 4 failures = 2,190 hours (≈ 91 days)
```

### 3. Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)

**Definition**: The average time required to repair a failed system and restore it to operational status.

**Formula**: 
```
MTTR = Total_Repair_Time / Number_of_Failures
```

**Components of MTTR**:
- **Detection Time**: Time to identify the failure
- **Response Time**: Time to begin repair activities
- **Diagnosis Time**: Time to identify the root cause
- **Repair Time**: Time to implement the fix
- **Recovery Time**: Time to restore full service

**Example Calculation**:
```
Failure incidents: 4
Total repair time: 8 hours

MTTR = 8 hours / 4 incidents = 2 hours average
```

### 4. Mean Time To Detect (MTTD)

**Definition**: The average time between when a failure occurs and when it's detected.

**Formula**: 
```
MTTD = Total_Detection_Time / Number_of_Incidents
```

**Factors Affecting MTTD**:
- Monitoring system effectiveness
- Alert configuration and sensitivity
- On-call response procedures
- Automated detection capabilities

### 5. Mean Time To Acknowledge (MTTA)

**Definition**: The average time between when an alert is triggered and when someone begins working on it.

**Formula**: 
```
MTTA = Total_Acknowledgment_Time / Number_of_Incidents
```

## Service Level Concepts

### Service Level Agreement (SLA)

**Definition**: A formal contract between service provider and customer defining expected service levels and consequences for not meeting them.

**Key Components**:
- **Availability Target**: e.g., 99.9% uptime
- **Performance Targets**: e.g., P95 response time < 200ms
- **Support Response Times**: e.g., Critical issues acknowledged within 15 minutes
- **Penalties**: Financial or service credits for SLA violations

**Example SLA**:
```
Web Application SLA:
- Availability: 99.9% monthly uptime
- Performance: P95 response time < 500ms
- Support: Critical issues acknowledged within 30 minutes
- Penalty: 5% service credit for each 0.1% below 99.9%
```

### Service Level Objective (SLO)

**Definition**: Internal targets for service performance that are typically more stringent than SLAs.

**Purpose**:
- Provide buffer between internal targets and external commitments
- Guide engineering decisions and priorities
- Establish error budgets for reliability vs feature velocity trade-offs

**Example SLOs**:
```
Internal SLOs (more stringent than SLA):
- Availability: 99.95% (SLA: 99.9%)
- P95 Response Time: 300ms (SLA: 500ms)
- Error Rate: < 0.01% (SLA: < 0.1%)
```

### Service Level Indicator (SLI)

**Definition**: Quantitative measures of service performance that are used to evaluate SLOs.

**Common SLIs**:
- **Availability SLI**: `(Successful_Requests / Total_Requests) × 100%`
- **Latency SLI**: `Percentage of requests served faster than threshold`
- **Throughput SLI**: `Requests processed per second`
- **Quality SLI**: `Percentage of requests returning correct results`

**Example SLI Measurements**:
```
Availability SLI:
- Successful requests (2xx, 3xx): 99,950
- Failed requests (4xx, 5xx): 50
- Total requests: 100,000
- Availability SLI = 99,950 / 100,000 = 99.95%

Latency SLI:
- Requests < 300ms: 95,000
- Total requests: 100,000
- Latency SLI = 95,000 / 100,000 = 95%
```

## Error Budget Concept

**Definition**: The amount of unreliability that a service can accumulate over a period while still meeting its SLO.

**Formula**: 
```
Error_Budget = (1 - SLO) × Total_Time_or_Requests
```

**Example Calculation**:
```
Monthly SLO: 99.9% availability
Total time in month: 30 days = 43,200 minutes

Error Budget = (1 - 0.999) × 43,200 = 43.2 minutes of downtime allowed
```

**Error Budget Usage**:
- **Under Budget**: Can take more risks, deploy more frequently
- **Over Budget**: Focus on reliability, slow down feature releases
- **At Budget**: Balanced approach between features and reliability

## Practical Reliability Calculations

### Composite System Availability

**Serial Systems** (all components must work):
```
Total_Availability = A₁ × A₂ × A₃ × ... × Aₙ

Example:
Web Server: 99.9%
Database: 99.8%
Load Balancer: 99.95%

Total = 0.999 × 0.998 × 0.9995 = 99.65%
```

**Parallel Systems** (redundant components):
```
Total_Availability = 1 - (1 - A₁) × (1 - A₂) × ... × (1 - Aₙ)

Example:
Two web servers in parallel, each 99.9%:
Total = 1 - (1 - 0.999) × (1 - 0.999) = 1 - 0.001² = 99.9999%
```

### Availability Planning

**Downtime Budget Calculation**:
```
Target Availability: 99.95%
Time Period: 1 year = 525,600 minutes

Allowed Downtime = (1 - 0.9995) × 525,600 = 262.8 minutes ≈ 4.4 hours/year
```

**Monthly Breakdown**:
```
Monthly Downtime Budget = 262.8 / 12 = 21.9 minutes/month
Weekly Downtime Budget = 262.8 / 52 = 5.1 minutes/week
```

## Reliability Engineering Practices

### 1. Chaos Engineering

**Purpose**: Proactively test system resilience by introducing controlled failures.

**Common Experiments**:
- **Network Partitions**: Simulate network splits between services
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Consume CPU, memory, or disk space
- **Service Failures**: Randomly terminate service instances
- **Latency Injection**: Add artificial delays to requests

**Example Chaos Experiment**:
```
Experiment: Database Connection Pool Exhaustion
Hypothesis: System gracefully handles DB connection limits
Method: Gradually increase connection usage to 100%
Success Criteria: 
- Error rate stays < 1%
- P95 latency increases < 2x
- System recovers within 5 minutes
```

### 2. Circuit Breaker Pattern

**Purpose**: Prevent cascading failures by failing fast when dependencies are unhealthy.

**States**:
- **Closed**: Normal operation, requests pass through
- **Open**: Dependency is failing, requests fail immediately
- **Half-Open**: Testing if dependency has recovered

**Configuration Example**:
```
Circuit Breaker Settings:
- Failure Threshold: 50% error rate
- Request Volume Threshold: 20 requests/minute
- Sleep Window: 60 seconds
- Success Threshold: 5 consecutive successes
```

### 3. Bulkhead Pattern

**Purpose**: Isolate critical resources to prevent failure propagation.

**Implementation Examples**:
- **Thread Pools**: Separate pools for different operations
- **Connection Pools**: Dedicated DB connections for critical vs non-critical operations
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-tenant or per-feature rate limits

## Reliability vs Performance Trade-offs

### The Reliability-Performance Spectrum

```
High Reliability Focus:
✅ Multiple redundant systems
✅ Conservative resource allocation
✅ Extensive error handling
❌ Higher latency due to safety checks
❌ Lower throughput due to redundancy overhead

High Performance Focus:
✅ Optimized for speed and throughput
✅ Minimal overhead and redundancy
✅ Aggressive resource utilization
❌ Higher risk of failures
❌ Potential for cascading failures
```

### Balanced Approach

```
Reliability-Performance Balance:
• Critical Path: High reliability (99.99% availability)
• Non-Critical Features: High performance (optimized for speed)
• Graceful Degradation: Maintain core functionality during issues
• Circuit Breakers: Fail fast to maintain overall system health
```

- P3 (Low): Informational, response within 24 hours
```

### 3. Incident Response

```
Incident Response Process:
1. Detection (MTTD): Automated monitoring alerts
2. Acknowledgment (MTTA): On-call engineer responds
3. Triage: Assess severity and impact
4. Mitigation: Implement temporary fixes
5. Resolution: Implement permanent fixes
6. Post-Mortem: Learn and improve processes
```

## Summary

Reliability metrics provide essential insights into system stability and user experience:

- **Availability** is the most fundamental reliability metric, but MTBF and MTTR provide deeper insights
- **SLAs, SLOs, and SLIs** create a framework for managing reliability expectations and trade-offs
- **Error budgets** balance reliability with feature velocity and innovation
- **Composite system reliability** requires understanding how component failures affect overall system availability
- **Monitoring and incident response** processes are crucial for maintaining high reliability
- **Trade-offs** between reliability and performance must be carefully managed based on business requirements

Remember: Reliability is not just about preventing failures, but also about recovering quickly when failures occur. The goal is to build systems that are resilient, observable, and continuously improving.
