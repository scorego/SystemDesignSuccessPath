# Chapter 7: Performance & Reliability Concepts

## Overview

This chapter covers the fundamental concepts of performance and reliability in system design. You'll learn how to measure, analyze, and optimize system performance while ensuring reliability. We'll explore key metrics, testing methodologies, capacity planning strategies, and monitoring approaches that are essential for building scalable systems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- **Understand Performance Metrics**: Define and calculate key performance indicators like latency, throughput, and response time
- **Measure Reliability**: Calculate availability, MTBF, MTTR, and understand SLA/SLO/SLI concepts
- **Analyze Trade-offs**: Balance performance, scalability, and reliability requirements
- **Identify Bottlenecks**: Systematically find and analyze system performance bottlenecks
- **Design Performance Tests**: Create comprehensive testing strategies for different scenarios
- **Plan Capacity**: Estimate resource requirements and plan for growth
- **Implement Monitoring**: Set up effective monitoring and alerting systems

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, you should have:

- Basic understanding of system architecture (Chapter 6)
- Knowledge of scaling concepts (Chapter 5)
- Familiarity with distributed systems basics (Chapter 3)
- Understanding of network fundamentals (Chapter 2)

## Chapter Structure

1. **[Performance Metrics Explained](01-performance-metrics.md)** - Core performance indicators and calculation formulas
2. **[Reliability Metrics](02-reliability-metrics.md)** - Availability, MTBF, MTTR, and service level concepts
3. **[Performance vs Scalability vs Reliability Trade-offs](03-tradeoffs.md)** - Understanding and managing competing requirements
4. **[Bottleneck Identification & Analysis](04-bottlenecks.md)** - Systematic approach to finding performance issues
5. **[Performance Testing Basics](05-testing.md)** - Testing methodologies and practical examples

## Key Takeaways

- Performance and reliability are not just technical concerns but business requirements
- Measurement is essential - you can't improve what you don't measure
- Trade-offs are inevitable - understand the implications of your choices
- Proactive monitoring and capacity planning prevent reactive firefighting
- Testing should simulate real-world conditions and failure scenarios
