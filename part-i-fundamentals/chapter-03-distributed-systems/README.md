# Chapter 3: Distributed Systems Basics

## Overview

This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of distributed systems, which form the backbone of modern large-scale applications. You'll learn about the inherent challenges of building systems that span multiple machines, networks, and geographic locations. We'll explore the famous CAP theorem, different consistency models, and real-world trade-offs that system designers must navigate.

By the end of this chapter, you'll understand why distributed systems are both necessary and challenging, and you'll have the foundational knowledge needed to design resilient distributed architectures.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

- **Define distributed systems** and explain why they're essential for modern applications
- **Understand network partitions** and how they affect system behavior
- **Apply the CAP theorem** to analyze trade-offs in distributed system design
- **Compare consistency models** and choose appropriate ones for different use cases
- **Identify common challenges** in distributed systems and their mitigation strategies
- **Analyze real-world case studies** to understand practical distributed system implementations

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, you should have:

- Basic understanding of computer networks (covered in Chapter 2)
