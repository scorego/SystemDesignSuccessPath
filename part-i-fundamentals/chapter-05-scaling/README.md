# Chapter 5: Scaling Fundamentals

## Overview

This chapter explores the fundamental concepts of scaling systems to handle increased load, data, and users. You'll learn about different scaling approaches, from vertical scaling (adding more power to existing machines) to horizontal scaling (adding more machines), and understand when to use each approach. We'll cover data partitioning strategies, database sharding techniques, and the critical distinction between stateless and stateful services. Finally, we'll examine common scaling patterns and anti-patterns to help you make informed architectural decisions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- **Understand Scale Dimensions**: Identify different types of scale (users, data, requests, geographic) and their unique challenges
- **Compare Scaling Approaches**: Explain the differences between vertical and horizontal scaling, including benefits and limitations
- **Design Partitioning Strategies**: Apply horizontal, vertical, and functional partitioning techniques to distribute data effectively
- **Implement Sharding**: Design database sharding strategies with appropriate shard keys and understand rebalancing challenges
- **Architect Stateless Services**: Distinguish between stateless and stateful services and design for horizontal scalability
- **Apply Scaling Patterns**: Recognize common scaling patterns and avoid anti-patterns that limit system growth
- **Make Scaling Decisions**: Choose appropriate scaling strategies based on system requirements and constraints
