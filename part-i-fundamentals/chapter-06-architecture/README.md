# Chapter 6: Architecture Patterns & Styles

## Overview

This chapter explores the fundamental architectural patterns and styles used in modern software systems. You'll learn about different approaches to organizing and structuring applications, from traditional monolithic architectures to modern microservices and serverless patterns. Each pattern comes with its own trade-offs, benefits, and challenges that we'll examine through real-world examples and case studies.

Understanding these patterns is crucial for system design interviews and making informed architectural decisions in your projects. We'll provide decision frameworks to help you choose the right architecture for different scenarios.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- **Understand Core Patterns**: Explain the key characteristics, benefits, and drawbacks of major architectural patterns
- **Compare Architectures**: Analyze trade-offs between different architectural approaches using structured criteria
- **Make Informed Decisions**: Use decision trees and frameworks to select appropriate architectures for specific requirements
- **Recognize Real-world Applications**: Identify how major companies implement these patterns in their systems
- **Apply Best Practices**: Implement architectural patterns following industry-proven guidelines and avoiding common pitfalls
