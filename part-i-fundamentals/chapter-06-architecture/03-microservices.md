# Microservices Architecture

## Introduction

Microservices architecture is a design approach that structures an application as a collection of small, autonomous services that communicate over well-defined APIs. Each service is independently deployable, owns its data, and is built around specific business capabilities. This pattern has become the dominant architecture for modern cloud-native applications.

Unlike SOA's centralized governance model, microservices embrace decentralized decision-making and technology diversity. This approach enables organizations to scale development teams, adopt new technologies incrementally, and deploy services independently—but it also introduces significant complexity in distributed system management.

## Key Concepts

### What are Microservices?

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Microservices Architecture"
        subgraph "User Interface"
            WEB[Web App]
            MOBILE[Mobile App]
            API_GW[API Gateway]
        end
        
        subgraph "Microservices"
            USER_SVC[User Service]
            ORDER_SVC[Order Service]
            PRODUCT_SVC[Product Service]
            PAYMENT_SVC[Payment Service]
            NOTIFICATION_SVC[Notification Service]
        end
        
        subgraph "Data Layer"
            USER_DB[(User DB)]
            ORDER_DB[(Order DB)]
            PRODUCT_DB[(Product DB)]
            PAYMENT_DB[(Payment DB)]
        end
        
        WEB --> API_GW
        MOBILE --> API_GW
        
        API_GW --> USER_SVC
        API_GW --> ORDER_SVC
        API_GW --> PRODUCT_SVC
        
        ORDER_SVC --> PAYMENT_SVC
        ORDER_SVC --> NOTIFICATION_SVC
        
        USER_SVC --> USER_DB
        ORDER_SVC --> ORDER_DB
        PRODUCT_SVC --> PRODUCT_DB
        PAYMENT_SVC --> PAYMENT_DB
    end
```

### Core Microservices Principles

**Business Capability Alignment**
- Each service represents a specific business function
- Services are organized around business domains, not technical layers
- Clear ownership and responsibility boundaries

**Decentralized Governance**
- Teams choose their own technology stacks
- Independent deployment and release cycles
- Autonomous decision-making within service boundaries

**Failure Isolation**
- Service failures don't cascade to entire system
- Circuit breakers and bulkhead patterns
- Graceful degradation strategies

**Data Ownership**
- Each service owns its data and database
- No shared databases between services
- Data consistency through eventual consistency patterns

### Microservices vs Other Architectures

| Aspect | Monolithic | SOA | Microservices |
|--------|------------|-----|---------------|
| **Service Size** | Single application | Coarse-grained services | Fine-grained services |
| **Communication** | In-process | ESB-mediated | Direct API calls |
| **Data Management** | Shared database | Service databases | Service-owned data |
| **Governance** | Centralized | Centralized standards | Decentralized |
| **Technology Stack** | Uniform | Mostly uniform | Polyglot |
| **Deployment** | Single unit | Service-level | Independent services |
| **Team Structure** | Single team | Service teams | Cross-functional teams |

## Architecture Components

### API Gateway

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "API Gateway Functions"
        ROUTE[Request Routing]
        AUTH[Authentication]
        RATE[Rate Limiting]
        CACHE[Response Caching]
        MONITOR[Monitoring & Analytics]
        TRANSFORM[Request/Response Transformation]
    end
    
    subgraph "Client Applications"
        WEB[Web Application]
        MOBILE[Mobile App]
        PARTNER[Partner APIs]
    end
    
    subgraph "Backend Services"
        SVC1[User Service]
        SVC2[Order Service]
        SVC3[Product Service]
    end
    
    WEB --> ROUTE
    MOBILE --> AUTH
    PARTNER --> RATE
    
    ROUTE --> SVC1
    AUTH --> SVC2
    RATE --> SVC3
    
    CACHE --> MONITOR
    MONITOR --> TRANSFORM
```

**API Gateway Responsibilities**
- **Request Routing**: Direct requests to appropriate services based on URL patterns
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Centralized security enforcement
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect services from overload and abuse
- **Request/Response Transformation**: Adapt between client and service formats
- **Monitoring & Analytics**: Track API usage and performance metrics
- **Circuit Breaking**: Prevent cascade failures in service chains

### Service Discovery

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Service Discovery Pattern"
        SVC[Service Instance] -->|1. Register| REGISTRY[Service Registry]
        CLIENT[Client Service] -->|2. Discover| REGISTRY
        REGISTRY -->|3. Service Info| CLIENT
        CLIENT -->|4. Direct Call| SVC
    end
    
    subgraph "Health Checking"
        REGISTRY -->|Health Check| SVC
        SVC -->|Health Status| REGISTRY
    end
```

**Discovery Mechanisms**
- **Client-Side Discovery**: Clients query registry and handle load balancing
- **Server-Side Discovery**: Load balancer queries registry and routes requests
- **Service Mesh**: Infrastructure layer handles discovery and routing

### Communication Patterns

**Synchronous Communication**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant OrderService
    participant PaymentService
    participant InventoryService
    
    Client->>OrderService: Create Order
    OrderService->>PaymentService: Process Payment
    PaymentService-->>OrderService: Payment Confirmed
    OrderService->>InventoryService: Reserve Items
    InventoryService-->>OrderService: Items Reserved
    OrderService-->>Client: Order Created
```

**Asynchronous Communication**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant OrderService
    participant EventBus
    participant PaymentService
    participant InventoryService
    participant NotificationService
    
    Client->>OrderService: Create Order
    OrderService-->>Client: Order Accepted
    OrderService->>EventBus: OrderCreated Event
    
    EventBus->>PaymentService: Process Payment
    EventBus->>InventoryService: Reserve Items
    
    PaymentService->>EventBus: PaymentProcessed Event
    InventoryService->>EventBus: ItemsReserved Event
    
    EventBus->>NotificationService: Send Confirmation
```

### Amazon's Service-Oriented Evolution

**Amazon's Two-Pizza Team Rule**
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Amazon's Service Organization"
        subgraph "Team A (≤8 people)"
            SVC_A[Service A]
            DB_A[(Database A)]
            SVC_A --> DB_A
        end
        
        subgraph "Team B (≤8 people)"
            SVC_B[Service B]
            DB_B[(Database B)]
            SVC_B --> DB_B
        end
        
        subgraph "Team C (≤8 people)"
            SVC_C[Service C]
            DB_C[(Database C)]
            SVC_C --> DB_C
        end
        
        SVC_A -.->|API Only| SVC_B
        SVC_B -.->|API Only| SVC_C
    end
```

**Amazon's Microservices Principles**
- **API-First**: All service communication through APIs
- **Team Ownership**: Each team owns their service end-to-end
- **Decentralized**: No shared databases or direct service dependencies
- **Autonomous**: Teams make independent technology and deployment decisions

## Best Practices

### Service Design Principles

**Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Domain-Driven Service Boundaries"
        subgraph "User Management Domain"
            USER_SVC[User Service]
            PROFILE_SVC[Profile Service]
            AUTH_SVC[Authentication Service]
        end
        
        subgraph "Order Management Domain"
            ORDER_SVC[Order Service]
            CART_SVC[Cart Service]
            CHECKOUT_SVC[Checkout Service]
        end
        
        subgraph "Product Catalog Domain"
            PRODUCT_SVC[Product Service]
            INVENTORY_SVC[Inventory Service]
            SEARCH_SVC[Search Service]
        end
        
        USER_SVC -.-> ORDER_SVC
        ORDER_SVC -.-> PRODUCT_SVC
    end
```

**Service Sizing Guidelines**
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service should have one clear business purpose
- **Team Ownership**: Service should be manageable by one team (2-8 people)
- **Independent Deployment**: Service should be deployable without coordinating with other teams
- **Data Cohesion**: Related data should be managed by the same service

### Data Management Strategies

**Database per Service Pattern**
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Microservices Data Isolation"
        subgraph "User Service"
            USER_SVC[User Service]
            USER_DB[(User Database<br/>PostgreSQL)]
            USER_SVC --> USER_DB
        end
        
        subgraph "Order Service"
            ORDER_SVC[Order Service]
            ORDER_DB[(Order Database<br/>MongoDB)]
            ORDER_SVC --> ORDER_DB
        end
        
        subgraph "Analytics Service"
            ANALYTICS_SVC[Analytics Service]
            ANALYTICS_DB[(Analytics Database<br/>ClickHouse)]
            ANALYTICS_SVC --> ANALYTICS_DB
        end
        
        USER_SVC -.->|API Calls| ORDER_SVC
        ORDER_SVC -.->|Events| ANALYTICS_SVC
    end
```

**Data Consistency Patterns**

**Saga Pattern for Distributed Transactions**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant OrderService
    participant PaymentService
    participant InventoryService
    participant ShippingService
    
    Note over OrderService: Orchestrator Saga
    OrderService->>PaymentService: Charge Payment
    PaymentService-->>OrderService: Payment Success
    
    OrderService->>InventoryService: Reserve Items
    InventoryService-->>OrderService: Items Reserved
    
    OrderService->>ShippingService: Schedule Shipping
    ShippingService-->>OrderService: Shipping Failed
    
    Note over OrderService: Compensating Actions
    OrderService->>InventoryService: Release Items
    OrderService->>PaymentService: Refund Payment
```

**Event Sourcing Pattern**
```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Event Sourcing"
        CMD[Command] --> SVC[Service]
        SVC --> EVENT[Event Store]
        EVENT --> PROJ[Projection/View]
        
        EVENT --> EVENT1[OrderCreated]
        EVENT --> EVENT2[PaymentProcessed]
        EVENT --> EVENT3[ItemsShipped]
    end
```

### Communication Best Practices

**API Design Guidelines**
```json
// RESTful API Example
{
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "endpoints": {
    "orders": {
      "GET /orders": "List orders with pagination",
      "POST /orders": "Create new order",
      "GET /orders/{id}": "Get specific order",
      "PUT /orders/{id}": "Update order",
      "DELETE /orders/{id}": "Cancel order"
    }
  },
  "errorHandling": {
    "standardCodes": [400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 500],
    "errorFormat": {
      "error": {
        "code": "INVALID_ORDER_STATUS",
        "message": "Order cannot be modified in current status",
        "details": "Order is already shipped"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Circuit Breaker Pattern**
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Closed
    Closed --> Open : Failure threshold reached
    Open --> HalfOpen : Timeout period elapsed
    HalfOpen --> Closed : Success
    HalfOpen --> Open : Failure
    
    note right of Closed : Normal operation<br/>Requests pass through
    note right of Open : Fail fast<br/>Requests rejected immediately
    note right of HalfOpen : Test recovery<br/>Limited requests allowed
```

### Deployment and Operations

**Container-Based Deployment**
```yaml
# Docker Compose Example
version: '3.8'
services:
  user-service:
    image: user-service:latest
    ports:
      - "8081:8080"
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user-db:5432/users
    depends_on:
      - user-db
      
  order-service:
    image: order-service:latest
    ports:
      - "8082:8080"
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=mongodb://order-db:27017/orders
    depends_on:
      - order-db
      
  api-gateway:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    depends_on:
      - user-service
      - order-service
```

**Kubernetes Deployment**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: user-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: user-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: user-service
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: user-service
        image: user-service:v1.2.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        env:
        - name: DATABASE_URL
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: db-secret
              key: url
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
          limits:
            memory: "512Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
```

### Monitoring and Observability

**Three Pillars of Observability**
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Observability Stack"
        subgraph "Metrics"
            PROM[Prometheus]
            GRAF[Grafana]
            ALERT[AlertManager]
        end
        
        subgraph "Logging"
            ELK[ELK Stack]
            FLUENTD[Fluentd]
            KIBANA[Kibana]
        end
        
        subgraph "Tracing"
            JAEGER[Jaeger]
            ZIPKIN[Zipkin]
            OTEL[OpenTelemetry]
        end
        
        PROM --> GRAF
        GRAF --> ALERT
        
        FLUENTD --> ELK
        ELK --> KIBANA
        
        OTEL --> JAEGER
        JAEGER --> ZIPKIN
    end
```

**Distributed Tracing Example**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant APIGateway
    participant UserService
    participant OrderService
    participant PaymentService
    
    Note over Client,PaymentService: Trace ID: abc123
    
    Client->>APIGateway: Request (Span: gateway)
    APIGateway->>UserService: Validate User (Span: user-validation)
    UserService-->>APIGateway: User Valid
    APIGateway->>OrderService: Create Order (Span: order-creation)
    OrderService->>PaymentService: Process Payment (Span: payment)
    PaymentService-->>OrderService: Payment Success
    OrderService-->>APIGateway: Order Created
    APIGateway-->>Client: Response
```

## Microservices Challenges and Solutions

### Common Challenges

**Distributed System Complexity**
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Complexity Sources"
        NET[Network Latency]
        FAIL[Partial Failures]
        CONS[Data Consistency]
        DEPLOY[Deployment Coordination]
        DEBUG[Debugging Difficulty]
        TEST[Testing Complexity]
    end
    
    subgraph "Solutions"
        CIRCUIT[Circuit Breakers]
        SAGA[Saga Pattern]
        CONTAINER[Containerization]
        TRACE[Distributed Tracing]
        CONTRACT[Contract Testing]
    end
    
    NET --> CIRCUIT
    FAIL --> CIRCUIT
    CONS --> SAGA
    DEPLOY --> CONTAINER
    DEBUG --> TRACE
    TEST --> CONTRACT
```

**Data Consistency Challenges**
- **Problem**: No ACID transactions across services
- **Solutions**: Saga pattern, event sourcing, eventual consistency
- **Trade-offs**: Complexity vs consistency guarantees

**Service Communication Overhead**
- **Problem**: Network calls add latency and failure points
- **Solutions**: Caching, async communication, service mesh
- **Monitoring**: Track service-to-service communication patterns

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Distributed Monolith**
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Anti-Pattern: Distributed Monolith"
        SVC1[Service A] --> SVC2[Service B]
        SVC2 --> SVC3[Service C]
        SVC3 --> SVC4[Service D]
        SVC4 --> SVC1
        
        note1[Tight Coupling]
        note2[Synchronous Calls]
        note3[Shared Database]
        
        SVC1 -.-> note1
        SVC2 -.-> note2
        SVC3 -.-> note3
    end
    
    subgraph "Better Pattern: Loose Coupling"
        SVC5[Service A] -.->|Events| BUS[Event Bus]
        SVC6[Service B] -.->|Events| BUS
        SVC7[Service C] -.->|Events| BUS
        
        BUS -.-> SVC5
        BUS -.-> SVC6
        BUS -.-> SVC7
    end
```

**Chatty Interfaces**
- **Problem**: Too many fine-grained API calls
- **Solution**: Aggregate APIs, batch operations, GraphQL

**Shared Databases**
- **Problem**: Services sharing the same database
- **Solution**: Database per service, event-driven data synchronization

## Migration Strategies

### Strangler Fig Pattern

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Phase 1: Monolith"
        MONO[Monolithic Application]
        DB[(Shared Database)]
        MONO --> DB
    end
    
    subgraph "Phase 2: Gradual Extraction"
        MONO2[Reduced Monolith]
        SVC1[User Service]
        DB2[(Shared DB)]
        DB3[(User DB)]
        
        MONO2 --> DB2
        SVC1 --> DB3
        MONO2 -.->|API| SVC1
    end
    
    subgraph "Phase 3: Full Microservices"
        SVC2[User Service]
        SVC3[Order Service]
        SVC4[Product Service]
        DB4[(User DB)]
        DB5[(Order DB)]
        DB6[(Product DB)]
        
        SVC2 --> DB4
        SVC3 --> DB5
        SVC4 --> DB6
        
        SVC2 -.->|API| SVC3
        SVC3 -.->|API| SVC4
    end
```

### Database Decomposition
