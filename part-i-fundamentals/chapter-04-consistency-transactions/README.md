# Chapter 4: Data Consistency & Transactions

## Overview

Data consistency and transactions are fundamental concepts in system design that determine how systems handle data integrity, especially when dealing with concurrent operations and distributed environments. This chapter explores the trade-offs between consistency guarantees and system availability, covering both traditional ACID properties and modern BASE principles.

Understanding these concepts is crucial for designing reliable systems that can handle real-world scenarios involving multiple users, concurrent operations, and potential failures. We'll examine how different consistency models affect system behavior and when to apply each approach.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- **Understand ACID Properties**: Explain Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability with practical examples
- **Compare ACID vs BASE**: Analyze the trade-offs between strong consistency and high availability
- **Master Transaction Isolation**: Identify and prevent common concurrency issues like dirty reads and phantom reads
- **Design for Distributed Systems**: Apply two-phase commit and consensus algorithms in distributed environments
- **Make Informed Decisions**: Choose appropriate consistency models based on business requirements and system constraints

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this chapter, you should be familiar with:

- **Database Basics**: Understanding of relational databases, tables, and basic SQL operations
- **Concurrent Programming**: Basic knowledge of threads, locks, and race conditions
- **Distributed Systems Concepts**: Familiarity with network partitions and the CAP theorem (covered in Chapter 3)
- **System Design Fundamentals**: Understanding of trade-offs and system requirements (covered in Chapter 1)
