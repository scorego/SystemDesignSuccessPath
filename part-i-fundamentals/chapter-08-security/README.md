# Chapter 8: Security & Privacy Fundamentals

## Overview

Security is not an afterthought in system designâ€”it's a fundamental requirement that must be considered at every level of your architecture. This chapter covers essential security principles, common threats, and practical mitigation strategies that every system designer should understand.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will understand:

- Core security principles and how they apply to distributed systems
- The difference between authentication and authorization
- Common security threats and their mitigation strategies
- Encryption fundamentals and when to use different approaches
- How HTTPS and TLS protect data in transit
- Privacy principles and compliance requirements
- Security best practices for system design

## Chapter Structure

### [Security Principles](01-security-principles.md)

## Key Concepts

- **CIA Triad**: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights
- **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify
- **Encryption at Rest and in Transit**: Protecting data everywhere
- **Security by Design**: Building security into the system from the start

## Real-World Applications

Security considerations are critical in:
- User authentication systems
- Payment processing platforms
- Healthcare data systems
- Financial trading platforms
- Social media platforms
