# Chapter 2: Computing Networks Fundamentals

## Overview

This chapter provides a comprehensive foundation in computer networking concepts essential for system design. You'll learn about network protocols, models, and troubleshooting techniques that form the backbone of distributed systems. Understanding these concepts is crucial for designing scalable, reliable systems that communicate effectively across networks.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Explain the OSI 7-layer model and how data flows through network layers
- Understand the TCP/IP 4-layer model and its practical applications
- Configure and troubleshoot IP addressing, subnetting, and routing
- Describe DNS resolution process and common record types
- Analyze HTTP/HTTPS protocols and their role in web communication
- Implement WebSocket connections for real-time applications
- Use network troubleshooting tools to diagnose connectivity issues
- Apply networking knowledge to system design decisions
