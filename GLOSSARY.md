# Glossary

## A

**ACID**
Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability - properties that guarantee database transactions are processed reliably.

**API**
Application Programming Interface - a set of protocols and tools for building software applications.

**Availability**
The percentage of time a system is operational and accessible when required for use.

## B

**BASE**
Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency - properties of distributed systems that prioritize availability over consistency.

**Bottleneck**
A point in a system where the flow of data is limited or restricted, causing performance degradation.

## C

**CAP Theorem**
States that in a distributed system, you can only guarantee two of three properties: Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance.

**CDN**
Content Delivery Network - a distributed network of servers that deliver web content based on geographic location.

**Consistency**
All nodes in a distributed system see the same data at the same time.

## D

**DNS**
Domain Name System - translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses.

**Distributed System**
A system whose components are located on different networked computers that communicate by passing messages.

## E

**Eventual Consistency**
A consistency model where the system will become consistent over time, provided no new updates are made.

## F

**Failover**
The process of switching to a backup system when the primary system fails.

## H

**Horizontal Scaling**
Adding more servers to handle increased load (scaling out).

**HTTP**
HyperText Transfer Protocol - the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web.

## L

**Latency**
The time it takes for a request to travel from source to destination and back.

**Load Balancer**
A device that distributes network traffic across multiple servers.

## M

**Microservices**
An architectural approach where applications are built as a collection of loosely coupled services.

## N

**NoSQL**
Non-relational databases designed for specific data models and flexible schemas.

## P

**Partition Tolerance**
The system continues to operate despite network failures that partition the system.

## Q

**QPS**
Queries Per Second - a measure of system throughput.

## R

**Replication**
The process of copying data from one database server to another.

**REST**
Representational State Transfer - an architectural style for designing networked applications.

## S

**Scalability**
The ability of a system to handle increased load by adding resources.

**Sharding**
A database partitioning technique that splits large databases into smaller, more manageable pieces.

**SLA**
Service Level Agreement - a commitment between a service provider and client.

## T

**Throughput**
The number of requests a system can handle per unit of time.

**TCP/IP**
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol - the basic communication language of the Internet.

## V

**Vertical Scaling**
Adding more power (CPU, RAM) to existing servers (scaling up).

## W

**WebSocket**
A communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
