## Key Concepts

### Database Selection Criteria

    A --> C[Scalability Needs]
    A --> D[Consistency Requirements]
    A --> E[Query Patterns]
    
    B --> F[Structured → SQL]
    B --> G[Semi-structured → Document]
    B --> H[Simple K-V → Key-Value]
    B --> I[Relationships → Graph]
    
    C --> J[Vertical → Single Server]
    C --> K[Horizontal → Distributed]
    
    D --> L[Strong → ACID]
    D --> M[Eventual → BASE]
    
    E --> N[Complex Queries → SQL]
    E --> O[Simple Lookups → NoSQL]
```

### Scaling Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Recommended Approach | Database Type | Key Considerations |
|----------|---------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Small to Medium App** | Vertical Scaling | PostgreSQL/MySQL | Cost-effective, simple operations |
| **Read-Heavy Workload** | Read Replicas | SQL + Caching | Geographic distribution |
| **Write-Heavy Workload** | Sharding/NoSQL | Cassandra/MongoDB | Partition strategy crucial |
| **Complex Relationships** | Optimized SQL | PostgreSQL + Graph DB | Hybrid approach |
| **Real-time Analytics** | Stream Processing | Kafka + Time-series DB | Lambda architecture |
| **Global Distribution** | Multi-region NoSQL | DynamoDB/Cassandra | Eventual consistency |

### Performance Optimization Checklist

**Relational Databases:**
- [ ] Proper indexing strategy implemented
- [ ] Query execution plans analyzed
- [ ] Connection pooling configured
- [ ] Slow query monitoring enabled
- [ ] Database statistics updated regularly

**NoSQL Databases:**
- [ ] Appropriate consistency level chosen
- [ ] Data model optimized for access patterns
- [ ] Partition/shard key designed properly
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures tested

**Scaling Considerations:**
- [ ] Read/write patterns analyzed
- [ ] Bottlenecks identified and addressed
- [ ] Failover procedures documented
- [ ] Data migration strategy planned
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established

## Common Patterns and Anti-Patterns

### ✅ Good Patterns

**Database Per Service (Microservices)**
```
Service A → Database A (User data)
Service B → Database B (Order data)  
Service C → Database C (Product data)
```

**CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**
```
Write Model → Optimized for writes → Event Store
Read Model → Optimized for queries → Materialized Views
```

**Database Caching Layers**
```
Application → Cache (Redis) → Database
```

### ❌ Anti-Patterns

**Shared Database Across Services**
```
Service A ↘
Service B → Shared Database ← Tight coupling, deployment issues
Service C ↗
```

**N+1 Query Problem**
```sql
-- Bad: Multiple queries
SELECT * FROM users;
-- Then for each user:
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE user_id = ?;

-- Good: Single join query
SELECT u.*, o.* FROM users u 
LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id;
```

**Premature Sharding**
```
Start simple → Scale vertically → Add read replicas → Then consider sharding
```

## Real-World Examples

    A --> D[Product Service - Elasticsearch]
    A --> E[Order Service - MySQL]
    A --> F[Analytics - ClickHouse]
    
    C --> G[User Read Replicas]
    E --> H[Order Read Replicas]
    
    I[ETL Pipeline] --> F
    C --> I
    E --> I
    D --> I
```

### Social Media Platform Database Strategy

    A[Social Media App] --> B[User Profiles - MongoDB]
    A --> C[Social Graph - Neo4j]
    A --> D[Posts/Timeline - Cassandra]
    A --> E[Real-time Chat - Redis]
    A --> F[Media Storage - S3 + CDN]
    
    G[Stream Processing] --> D
    H[Recommendation Engine] --> C
    I[Analytics Pipeline] --> J[Data Warehouse]
```

## Interview Focus Areas

When discussing databases in system design interviews:

1. **Start with Requirements**: Understand data model, scale, and consistency needs
2. **Choose Appropriate Technology**: Justify database selection based on requirements
3. **Design for Scale**: Discuss scaling strategies and trade-offs
4. **Consider Consistency**: Address CAP theorem implications
5. **Plan for Operations**: Include monitoring, backup, and disaster recovery

## Summary

Database systems are critical components that require careful consideration of:

- **Data model requirements** and access patterns
- **Scalability needs** and growth projections  
- **Consistency requirements** and trade-offs
- **Operational complexity** and team expertise
- **Cost implications** of different approaches

The key is to start simple and scale incrementally, choosing the right tool for each specific use case while maintaining system reliability and performance.

## Next Steps

- Practice designing database schemas for different use cases
- Experiment with different database technologies
- Study real-world scaling case studies
- Learn about database monitoring and optimization tools
- Understand the operational aspects of database management
