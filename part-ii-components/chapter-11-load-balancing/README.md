# Chapter 11: Load Balancing & Traffic Management

## Overview

Load balancing and traffic management are critical components of scalable distributed systems. This chapter explores how to distribute incoming requests across multiple servers efficiently, ensure high availability through intelligent routing, and implement service discovery patterns that enable dynamic scaling.

As systems grow from single servers to distributed architectures, load balancing becomes essential for:
- **Performance**: Distributing load to prevent server overload
- **Availability**: Providing redundancy and failover capabilities  
- **Scalability**: Enabling horizontal scaling by adding more servers
- **Reliability**: Implementing health checks and automatic recovery

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will understand:

- **Load Balancing Algorithms**: Round robin, weighted algorithms, least connections, IP hash, and when to use each
- **Load Balancer Types**: Layer 4 vs Layer 7 load balancing, hardware vs software solutions
- **Service Discovery**: Client-side vs server-side discovery, registry patterns, and implementation approaches
- **Traffic Routing**: Advanced routing strategies, failover mechanisms, and traffic splitting
- **Health Monitoring**: Health check patterns, circuit breakers, and graceful degradation
- **Real-world Implementation**: Configuration examples with Nginx, HAProxy, and cloud load balancers

## Key Concepts Quick Reference

| Concept | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Round Robin** | Sequential distribution | Equal server capacity |
| **Weighted Round Robin** | Proportional distribution | Mixed server capacity |
| **Least Connections** | Route to least busy server | Long-lived connections |
| **IP Hash** | Consistent client routing | Session affinity |
| **Layer 4 LB** | Transport layer routing | High performance |
| **Layer 7 LB** | Application layer routing | Content-based routing |
| **Service Registry** | Central service catalog | Dynamic environments |
| **Health Checks** | Server availability monitoring | Fault tolerance |

## Real-World Context

Load balancing is ubiquitous in modern systems:

- **Web Applications**: Distributing HTTP requests across web servers
- **Databases**: Read replicas and connection pooling
- **Microservices**: Service-to-service communication routing
- **CDNs**: Geographic traffic distribution
- **API Gateways**: Request routing and rate limiting
- **Container Orchestration**: Pod-to-pod load balancing in Kubernetes

Understanding these patterns is essential for designing systems that can handle real-world traffic patterns and scale reliably.

## What You'll Build

Throughout this chapter, you'll implement:

- A complete load balancer with multiple algorithms
- Service discovery mechanisms for dynamic environments
- Health checking and failover systems
- Traffic routing strategies for different scenarios
- Real-world configuration examples

Let's start by understanding the fundamental algorithms that power load balancing systems.
