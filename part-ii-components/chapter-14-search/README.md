# Chapter 14: Search & Indexing Systems

## Overview

This chapter covers search and indexing systems, which are critical components for enabling users to find relevant information quickly in large datasets. We'll explore full-text search engines, search algorithms, indexing strategies, and recommendation systems that power modern applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will understand:

- How full-text search engines work and when to use them
- Core search algorithms and ranking mechanisms
- Indexing strategies for optimal search performance
- Different types of recommendation systems and their algorithms
- How to choose the right search technology for your use case
- Performance optimization techniques for search systems

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of data structures (trees, hash tables)
- Familiarity with databases and SQL
- Understanding of distributed systems concepts
- Knowledge of basic algorithms and complexity analysis
