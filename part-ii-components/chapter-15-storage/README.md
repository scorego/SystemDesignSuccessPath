# Chapter 15: File Storage & Content Delivery

## Overview

This chapter explores the critical components of modern file storage and content delivery systems. You'll learn about different storage architectures, how Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) optimize global content distribution, media processing pipelines for handling multimedia content at scale, and backup strategies for ensuring data durability and disaster recovery.

Understanding these systems is essential for designing applications that handle large amounts of data, serve global audiences, and require high availability and performance.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Compare different storage system architectures and choose the right approach for your use case
- Design CDN strategies to optimize content delivery performance globally
- Architect media processing pipelines for handling video, audio, and image content
- Implement backup and disaster recovery strategies for data protection
- Understand the trade-offs between different storage technologies and approaches
- Design systems that can handle petabytes of data with high availability
