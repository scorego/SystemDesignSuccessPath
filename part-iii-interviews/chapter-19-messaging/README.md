# Chapter 19: Communication & Messaging Systems

This chapter covers the design of various communication and messaging systems, from personal messaging apps to enterprise communication platforms and video conferencing systems. Each system presents unique challenges in terms of real-time communication, scalability, security, and user experience.

## Problems Covered

1. **WhatsApp Messaging System** - Personal messaging with end-to-end encryption
2. **Slack Team Communication** - Enterprise messaging with channels and integrations
3. **Email System Design** - Traditional messaging with spam filtering and delivery
4. **Zoom Video Conferencing** - Real-time video communication at scale

## Key Concepts

- **Real-time Communication**: WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, WebRTC
- **Message Delivery**: At-least-once, at-most-once, exactly-once delivery
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Signal Protocol, key exchange, forward secrecy
- **Presence Systems**: Online/offline status, typing indicators
- **Push Notifications**: Mobile push, web push, notification delivery
- **Media Processing**: Image/video compression, transcoding, streaming
- **Spam Detection**: Machine learning, reputation systems, content filtering
