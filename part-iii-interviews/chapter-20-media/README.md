# Chapter 20: Media & Entertainment Systems

This chapter covers the design of large-scale media and entertainment platforms that handle massive amounts of content, users, and real-time interactions. We'll explore four major system design problems that are commonly asked in interviews and represent different aspects of media systems.

## What You'll Learn

- **Video Streaming Architecture**: Design scalable video platforms with CDN optimization
- **Recommendation Systems**: Build ML-powered content discovery engines
- **Music Streaming Platforms**: Handle audio content with personalization features
- **Live Streaming Systems**: Implement real-time broadcasting with interactive features

## Chapter Structure

1. **[YouTube Video Streaming](01-youtube.md)** - Design a global video platform with upload, processing, and streaming capabilities
2. **[Netflix Recommendation Engine](02-netflix.md)** - Build an intelligent content recommendation system with ML integration
3. **[Spotify Music Streaming](03-spotify.md)** - Create a music platform with personalization and social features
4. **[Twitch Live Streaming](04-twitch.md)** - Design a real-time streaming platform with interactive chat

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Content Delivery Networks (CDN)**: Global content distribution and edge caching
- **Video Processing Pipelines**: Transcoding, compression, and adaptive bitrate streaming
- **Machine Learning Systems**: Recommendation algorithms and personalization engines
- **Real-time Systems**: Live streaming protocols and low-latency communication
- **Data Analytics**: User behavior tracking and content performance metrics

## Interview Tips

Media and entertainment systems are popular interview topics because they:
- Combine multiple complex technical challenges
- Require understanding of both technical and business requirements
- Involve trade-offs between performance, cost, and user experience
- Test knowledge of modern distributed systems patterns

Each problem in this chapter includes detailed capacity estimation, architecture design, and scaling considerations that are essential for system design interviews.
